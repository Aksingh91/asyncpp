/**
   `series` runs a sequence of tasks, one after the other.  Each task is a std::function,
   which must accept a callback function which itself accepts an error code and a result
   value.  As each task is invoked, it should perform some work, then invoke the callback
   when it finishes.  If the callback is given some error_code that is not async::OK, then
   iteration stops and no more tasks are invoked.  When all tasks complete successfully or
   some task passes an error to its callback, then the `final_callback` will be called
   with the last error code and a vector of all return values.

   It is the responsibility of the caller that the `tasks` vector and `final_callback`
   passed to this function are not destroyed until `final_callback` is invoked.

   Notes:

   1. When a task is invoked, it may invoke its callback function immediately, or it may
     defer the callback.  For example, if Boost ASIO library is used to make an HTTP
     fetch or a deadline timer is started, the callback won't be invoked till some time
     in the future.  `series` handles that case correctly, and works if the callback is
     called immediately or deferred.
  2. `series` minimizes how much stack it uses.  Except for deferred callbacks, we
     don't invoke the next task from the previous task's callback -- otherwise the
     stack would grow on every task invocation.
